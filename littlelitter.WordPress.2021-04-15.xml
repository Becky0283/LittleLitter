<p>This is an example page. It's different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Hi there! I'm a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my website. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin' caught in the rain.)</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>...or something like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a new WordPress user, you should go to <a href="http:/wp-admin/">your dashboard</a> to delete this page and create new pages for your content. Have fun!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>About</h1>		
			<h3>Why we do this</h3>		
		<p>Melbourne water spends more than 3 million AUD per year to clean up its waterways. Most of the trash found in the waterways are those which are dropped in the streets of Melbourne. Cigarette butts and Disposable coffee cups, in particular, are one of the most polluting substances among the trash dropped in the streets. This dropped litter ends up in the waterways through the stormwater drains. This litter has very bad impacts on marine wildlife and also affects amenities and is very unsightly.</p>		
			<h3>Team KYTZ</h3>		
			<h2>Mission</h2>		
		<p>The mission of our website is to bring awareness that littering behavior in daily life can cause serious damage to nature environment. Moreover, human beings have to pay lots of effort to address the issue. Besides the awareness, we also provide our audience the basic skills, like litter classification, to protect the environment.</p>		
			<h2>Vision</h2>		
		<p>Instead of focusing on adults' behavior, our team pays more attention to the young generation. Since changing individuals' behavior is one of the most essential tasks to reduce littering and protect the environment. The young generation is more appreciates new pieces of knowledge and their behavior is easier to adjust to.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Unless you've got an already bare patch of earth, you'll need to remove the turf before planting your flowers. After marking the outline of your new flower bed&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/c/249354/456723/8154?subId1=BHGHowtoBuildaNewFlowerBedforAllYourFavoriteBloomsnbradleyLanPos46903201801I&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FRust-Oleum-Professional-15-oz-Fluorescent-Red-Orange-2X-Distance-Inverted-Marking-Spray-Paint-266590%2F203302842" target="_blank">with spray paint</a>&nbsp;or white flour, there are two basic ways to remove the grass on the inside of your lines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>dig up existing grass.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Digging out the grass can be hard work. Use a shovel to remove a section of grass from the center of your planned bed, then continue to remove turf by wedging the shovel under the edges of the grass. Then lift and peel the sod away. Once you have removed the grass, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/landscaping-projects/landscape-basics/how-to-prep-a-flowerbed/">prepare the soil for planting</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Make a flower bed without digging.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/yard/garden-care/building-a-flower-bed-without-digging/">Removing grass without digging</a>&nbsp;is a lengthy but easy method. Simply cover the entire area of your future flower bed with several overlapping sheets of newspaper. Layer the paper at least six pages deep, then cover the newspaper with several inches of rich soil or compost. Water well. Over the next few months, the buried grass will die, and the newspaper will decompose while adding nutrients to the soil. For best results, keep the area covered for up to a year before planting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Build a raised flower bed.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a few ways to do this. You can use wood boards cut to the desired length. This lets you build whatever shape or size you desire. But if you prefer the simplest solution, there are&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/c/249354/456723/8154?subId1=BHGHowtoBuildaNewFlowerBedforAllYourFavoriteBloomsnbradleyLanPos46903201801I&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FVigoro-4-ft-x-4-ft-Brown-Wood-and-Plastic-Composite-Raised-Garden-Bed-YTHD18042701%2F306342486" target="_blank">raised flower bed kits</a>&nbsp;that supply everything you need, and easily snap together with no need for sawing or hammering. Most kits create fairly small squares or rectangles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Flower Bed Plants</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You designed your flower bed, you removed the grass, you prepared the soil, and you edged your soon-to-be-planted site. Now it's time to plant! You'll want to choose varieties that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/gardening-by-region/regional-gardening/top-native-plants-for-your-region/">do well in your climate</a>, of course, and are suited to your site's exposure to sunlight. But beyond that, the best flowers are the ones you love the most.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Low-growing annuals such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/annual/sweet-alyssum/">sweet alyssum</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/perennial/lobelia/">lobelia</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/annual/impatiens/">impatiens</a>&nbsp;work well as front-of-the-border plants.</li><li>Add zing in the front of the house with a colorful mixture of varied-height beauties like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/annual/zinnia/">zinnias</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/annual/snapdragon/">snapdragons</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/bin/plants/?name=marigold&amp;zipZone=">marigolds</a>.</li><li>Tall flowers, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/annual/sunflower/">sunflowers</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/perennial/hollyhock/">hollyhocks</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/annual/cosmos/">cosmos</a>, can be especially inviting when flanking the steps to your front porch or along a property fence.</li><li>Raised flower bed planting ideas include a center row of tall and medium-height blooms with a border of cascading flowers like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/annual/bacopa/">bacopa</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/annual/geranium/">ivy geranium</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/annual/moss-rose/">moss rose</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/annual/calibrachoa/">calibrachoa</a><em>.</em></li><li>Other ideas include a garden of single-color flowers, a patriotic mix of red-white-and-blue blooms, a pastel flower bed, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plans/colorful/design-for-a-moon-garden/">a "moon garden" planted entirely in white flowers.</a></li></ul>
